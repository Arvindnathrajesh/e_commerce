## Project

This is a project created on NestJS framework of Node. There are no databases involved as I've used the in-memory data structures to store the data. 

Controllers contain the API declarations. Packages contain the DTOs, services and data manipulations and errors
Controllers call the services and services does the required functionalities.
Services cotains the business logic and data manipulations
